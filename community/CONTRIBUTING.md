## The Big Picture

Every contribution, no matter how small, moves this project forward.

A typo fix makes the docs clearer.
A successful build validates the design.
An improvement makes it accessible to more people.
A translation reaches a new community.

**You're part of making levitation technology free for humanity.**

That's pretty fucking cool.

Thank you for contributing.
