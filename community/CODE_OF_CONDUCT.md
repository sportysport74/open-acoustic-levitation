## The Spirit of This Project

**This isn't just about rules - it's about attitude:**

**We're building something revolutionary.** Acoustic levitation that anyone can build. Technology released freely instead of locked behind patents and paywalls.

**That requires a certain mindset:**

- **Punk rock DIY ethics** - Build it yourself, help others build it
- **Radical openness** - Share knowledge, not gatekeep it
- **Collaborative spirit** - We're stronger together
- **Fuck-the-establishment energy** - But channeled constructively
- **Respect for all backgrounds** - Genius can come from anywhere

**Think:** Underground maker culture meets academic rigor meets humanitarian mission.

## Philosophy

**From the trailer park to the cosmos.**

This project was started by someone living on scraps who had world-changing ideas. If we gatekeep or create barriers, we betray that origin story.

**Everyone is welcome here:**
- The PhD physicist and the high school dropout
- The professional engineer and the self-taught tinkerer
- The native English speaker and those using translation tools
- The person with a full lab and the person with a breadboard on their kitchen table

**The only requirements:**
- Genuine interest
- Willingness to learn and share
- Treating others with respect

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (version 2.1) and modified to reflect this project's specific culture and values.

## Questions?

**Not sure if something is acceptable?** Ask!

Better to ask than to accidentally cross a line. We're all learning how to build a revolutionary community here.

---

*This is a living document. As the community grows, we'll refine these guidelines based on what works.*

---

**Remember:** We're making levitation real and free for everyone.

That's only possible if we build a community where everyone can contribute.

Let's do this right.
